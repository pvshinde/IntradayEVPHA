A Modified Progressive Hedging Approach for Multistage Intraday Trade of EV Aggregators

Read me

For running the 12 stages version, first run the Read_xl_data.jl code to load the data
Then run the run_simple_EV.jl and it will call Full_EV_version.jl

For 11 stages: run the code run_11_stages.jl which will call Full_EV_11stages.jl

Run Read_14stages.jl code for reading the price data and then run the code run_14stages_EV.jl
13 stages: run the code run_13_stages.jl

DA_BM_EV.jl is the benchmark case with only DA and BM and without PHA

Use Julia version 1.3 to be able to run RandomizedProgressiveHedging package which is internally called through the provided codes.

The simulations are performed for 10 delivery products. Therefore, 10 xlsx files are provided for price data.
